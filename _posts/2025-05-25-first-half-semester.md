# Summary of First Half Semester: Fundamentals of Algorithms and Data Structures

In the first two weeks of the semester, students were introduced to the fundamental concepts of algorithms, which serve as the foundation of programming and computational problem solving. The discussion began with the definition of algorithms, the characteristics of a good algorithm, and how to systematically construct algorithms. Emphasis was also placed on understanding basic time and space complexity. Simple algorithms such as sorting and searching were introduced to help students become familiar with how algorithms work and how their performance is analyzed.

In weeks three and four, the focus shifted to basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Students learned how each data structure stores and manages data efficiently, as well as how to implement these structures in code. This understanding is crucial, as data structures are the building blocks for designing efficient algorithms. Discussions also included how to select the appropriate data structure based on the nature of the problem being addressed.

In weeks five and six, the material focused on the Divide-and-Conquer problem-solving paradigm. This approach involves breaking down a large problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving each individually, and then combining them to form the final solution. Classic algorithms such as merge sort and binary search were discussed as examples. This approach also required students to understand how to construct efficient recursive solutions and estimate their complexity.

Weeks seven and eight introduced students to the concept of Dynamic Programming (DP), an optimization technique that stores the results of overlapping sub-problems to avoid redundant computation. DP is particularly useful for problems with overlapping sub-problems. Examples such as the Fibonacci sequence, the knapsack problem, and the longest common subsequence were used to illustrate the importance of memory planning and sequential logic in constructing DP solutions.

Overall, the first half of the semester equipped students with a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, as well as several classical problem-solving strategies that will serve as a crucial foundation for the topics covered in the second half of the semester.
