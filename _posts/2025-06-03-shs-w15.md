# Week 15 Summary - Second Half Semester

In the 15th week of the second semester, two fundamental graph algorithms were discussed: **Kahn’s Algorithm** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.

## Kahn’s Algorithm

Kahn’s Algorithm is a method used to perform topological sorting on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which is a directed graph that does not contain any cycles. This algorithm utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to order the nodes based on their dependencies. In this context, a topological order means arranging the nodes such that if there is an edge from node _u_ to node _v_, then _u_ must appear before _v_ in the ordering.

This algorithm is particularly relevant in scenarios involving dependencies, such as course scheduling with prerequisites, software build systems, or project planning. The procedure starts by calculating the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node. All nodes with an in-degree of zero are added to a queue. Then, one by one, nodes are removed from the graph, and the in-degrees of their neighboring nodes are reduced. If all nodes are successfully processed, the graph has no cycle. However, if some nodes still have an in-degree greater than zero, a cycle exists in the graph.

One of the main advantages of Kahn’s Algorithm is its efficiency, with a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Additionally, it can detect cycles while performing topological sorting. However, its limitations include the inability to handle cyclic graphs and the need for auxiliary data structures such as queues, unordered maps, and vectors. Moreover, the algorithm may produce multiple valid topological orders depending on the graph’s structure.

Overall, Kahn’s Algorithm is a powerful and systematic tool for dependency-based ordering. Its implementation in programming languages like C++ demonstrates its flexibility and practicality in real-life scenarios, especially in course planning, program compilation, or dependency management in projects.

## Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a method used to find the shortest path from one node to another in a weighted graph. This graph consists of vertices connected by edges that carry certain weights or distances. The algorithm works systematically to determine the shortest path from a source node to a destination node, guaranteeing an optimal result as long as all edge weights are positive.

The algorithm begins by selecting a starting node and assigning a distance value of zero to it, while all other nodes are assigned an infinite distance. Each processed node is used as a reference to calculate the distance to its neighboring nodes, updating the distance if a shorter path is found. This process continues until all nodes have been examined and no shorter path can be discovered. For improved efficiency, data structures such as priority queues or min-heaps are often used to quickly select the next node with the minimum distance.

The application of Dijkstra’s Algorithm is extensive in daily life. A common example is in navigation systems like GPS, where users want to find the fastest route to a destination. Logistics companies also use Dijkstra to determine the most efficient delivery route, saving both time and cost. Since the algorithm requires positive edge weights, it is suitable for systems without negative weights, such as one-way roads or specific transportation networks.

The main advantage of Dijkstra’s Algorithm lies in its guarantee that the solution is always the shortest path. It is also very efficient when used on dense graphs and is often employed for solving single-source, all-destination path problems. However, it is less effective on graphs with negative edge weights or on large, sparse graphs. In such cases, alternative algorithms like Bellman-Ford or A* may be more appropriate due to their ability to handle directional and exploratory efficiency.

In conclusion, Dijkstra’s Algorithm remains one of the most accurate and widely used algorithms for shortest path search in graph theory and real-world applications. With its greedy approach, it builds the optimal solution step by step and has proven highly valuable in various domains, including route planning, logistics delivery, and computer network management.
