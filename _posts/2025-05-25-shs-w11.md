# Week 11 Summary - Second Half Semester

In the 11th week of the second half of the semester, two main topics were covered: **Activity Selection Problem** and **Fractional Knapsack**. Both topics are important examples of applying greedy algorithms to optimization problems.

## Activity Selection Problem

The Activity Selection Problem is a classic optimization problem that aims to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities based on their start and finish times. Two activities are considered compatible if they do not overlap in time â€” meaning the first activity must finish before the next one starts.

A commonly used solution is a greedy algorithm that selects the activity with the earliest finish time at each step. This approach is based on the idea that choosing the activity that ends the soonest will leave more room for additional activities. The algorithm starts by sorting the activities in ascending order based on their finish times, then selecting the first activity and continuing with the next activity that starts after the last selected one finishes.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, while the activity selection itself is done in O(n). The space complexity is O(n) to store the activities and the final selection.

The Activity Selection Problem has broad real-world applications such as classroom scheduling, process management in operating systems, logistics delivery optimization, and resource allocation in telecommunications. The greedy algorithm used is simple, efficient, and provides an optimal solution for cases without additional constraints, though it may not be suitable for more complex problems that require other methods.

## Fractional Knapsack

The Fractional Knapsack is a variation of the knapsack problem where items can be divided (fractionally), allowing the total value of items placed in the knapsack to be maximized without exceeding its weight capacity. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack, which only allows taking an item entirely or not at all, the fractional knapsack offers more flexibility and can be solved using a simpler greedy algorithm.

The greedy strategy in this problem is to calculate the value-to-weight ratio (value/weight) for each item and then sort the items in descending order based on this ratio. Items with the highest ratio are taken as much as possible until the knapsack is full, and if the next item cannot fit entirely, a fraction of it is taken according to the remaining capacity.

The main time complexity comes from sorting the items, which is O(n log n). Fractional Knapsack has many practical applications such as task scheduling with limited resources, investment allocation, network bandwidth distribution, and logistics optimization. The greedy algorithm is effective because making locally optimal choices leads to a globally optimal solution, although this approach does not work for the more complex 0/1 Knapsack.

With the discussion of these two important topics, Week 11 provides a deep understanding of how greedy algorithms are applied in various optimization contexts, both in activity scheduling and efficient resource allocation.
