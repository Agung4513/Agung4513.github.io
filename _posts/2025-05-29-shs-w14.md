# Week 14 Summary - Second Half Semester
In the 14th week of the second semester, three main topics were discussed: **Rat in a Maze**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

## Rat in a Maze

The Rat in a Maze problem is a classic algorithm that introduces the concept of pathfinding within a maze. The maze is represented as a two-dimensional matrix, where each cell has a value of 1 (traversable) or 0 (blocked). The goal of the algorithm is to find a path from the starting point—usually at the top-left corner of the matrix—to the destination at the bottom-right corner. This concept is ideal for introducing basic understanding of backtracking and recursion in programming.

The algorithm works as follows: the rat tries to move in four main directions (right, down, left, up) from one valid cell to another. If the chosen path leads to a dead end, the algorithm performs backtracking—reverting to the previous position and trying alternative paths. This process repeats until a solution is found or all possible paths have been evaluated.

The main strengths of the Rat in a Maze algorithm are its simplicity and flexibility. It is highly suitable for educational purposes since it doesn’t require complex data structures and can be modified to find all possible solutions in a maze. Additionally, its implementation can be applied in robot navigation simulations, maze-based games, and simple pathfinding systems.

However, this algorithm also has limitations. One of its major drawbacks is inefficiency at larger scales due to exponential time complexity. Furthermore, deep recursion can trigger stack overflow. The algorithm also does not guarantee the shortest path and may revisit the same path unless specially marked.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph or tree traversal method that focuses on level-order exploration. Using a queue data structure, BFS ensures that nodes on the same level are processed before moving to the next level. This approach is particularly efficient in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

Technically, BFS begins by inserting the starting node into the queue and marking it as visited. While the queue is not empty, nodes are dequeued from the front for examination, and all unvisited neighbors are enqueued. This process continues until the target is found or all nodes have been explored.

The strengths of BFS lie in its reliability for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. Additionally, since it does not use recursion, it is not susceptible to stack overflow. BFS is well-suited for scenarios involving large data sets requiring wide exploration, such as social network analysis, computer networking, or navigation applications.

On the downside, BFS consumes a lot of memory. As it stores all nodes from previous levels, memory usage can become significant, especially in large graphs. BFS is also less efficient for deep searches or graphs with great depth.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores one branch as deep as possible before backtracking to explore other branches. With a LIFO (Last-In First-Out) approach, DFS is typically implemented using a stack or recursion. This concept contrasts with BFS, as DFS prioritizes depth over breadth.

In practice, DFS starts from an initial node, then recursively explores one of its unvisited neighbors. This continues until the goal is reached or all branches have been explored. When no more neighbors are available, the algorithm backtracks to previous nodes to try alternate paths.

DFS has advantages in terms of more efficient memory usage compared to BFS. It is also ideal for deep searches, graph structure analysis like cycle detection, topological sorting, and exploring all possible solutions in a system. This algorithm is widely used in AI simulations, games, and network analytics.

Nevertheless, DFS does not guarantee finding the shortest path and may follow long, non-optimal paths. There is also a higher risk of stack overflow if not properly managed, especially when the search depth is significant or cycles are not properly handled.
